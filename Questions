Questions to find answers to:
A) What physics are you trying to model and analyse? (Describe clearly, in words, what physical phenomenon you wish to analyse)
B) What PDE are you trying to solve, associated with the Physics described in A? (write the PDE)
C) Boundary value and/or initial values for my specific problem: (be CONSISTENT with what you wrote in A)
D) What numerical method are you going to deploy and why? (Describe, in words, which method you intend to apply and why you have chosen it as opposed to other alternatives)
E) I am going to discretise my PDE as the following (show the steps from continuous to discrete equation and boundary/initial conditions
F) Plot the numerical results comprehensively and discuss them (discuss how the results describe the physics and comment on any discrepancies or unexpected behaviours). Use multiple types of visual graphs.

Easy!
